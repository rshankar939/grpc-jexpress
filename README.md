# grpc-jexpress
Developer friendly container for writing gRPC services using grpc-java, called GJEX - for Grpc Java Express.

Provides following features:
* Transparent gRPC runtime startup alongwith Jetty for dashboard/administration
* Guice module support to integrate gRPC service implementations with the gRPC runtime
* Metrics support - e.g. @Timed annotations to publish to JMX
* YAML based configuration support for gRPC service implementations
* Component Lifecycle (Start(), Stop()) support via Service interface
* Health Check - ability to add any number of deep Health Checks
* Custom web resources for enabling Control Path, Administration actions
* Filters - ability to add any number of Filters to gRPC stub method implementations
* Validation - using [Hibernate Validator](http://hibernate.org/validator/)
* Distributed Tracing - using [opentracing](http://opentracing.io/) and the [openzipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave) implementation
* Concurrent execution, Circuit breaking using [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) and Dispatch-Compose through a [FutureDecorator](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/grpc-jexpress/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/flipkart/gjex/core/task/FutureDecorator.java) API
* Deadlining for APIs - ability to specify execution timeouts for gRPC stubs at service end
* Task/Upstream request retries using [Hedged Requests as described here](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gmporter/classes/fa17/cse124/post/schedule/p74-dean.pdf)
* Tool recommendations for testing

## Releases
| Release | Date | Description |
|:---------------------------------|:----------------|:------------|
| Version 1.33                     | Nov 2019        |  Bug fixes, feature enhahncements
| Version 1.0                      | Jan 2019        |  Initial stable release

## Changelog
Changelog can be viewed in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/grpc-jexpress/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file

## Distribution
GJEX builds are distributed via the [Clojars](https://clojars.org/) community maintained repository for open source libraries. 
Add the following repository to your build system to access releases builds - e.g for Maven :

```xml
<repository>
    <id>clojars</id>
    <name>Clojars repository</name>
    <url>https://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
```
More details on [Distribution Binaries](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/grpc-jexpress/wiki/Distribution-Binaries)

## Building
You may also build GJEX from source. To build, clone this repository and run:

```
$ ./gradlew clean build install
```

## Examples
The [examples](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/grpc-jexpress/tree/master/examples) requires https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/tree/master/examples to already be built. 

Use the Maven build option in order to have the built examples binaries in your local Maven repository (e.g ~/.m2/repository). grpc-java is in active development and the master branch is often in SNAPSHOT versions that are not published to central repositories. It is therefore advisable to edit the examples build file (pom.xml) to use a published gRPC version instead of SNAPSHOT version. For e.g. we updated examples to use gRPC version 1.20.0 and produce built binary(.jar) with the same version.

To build the GJEX examples, run in the 'examples' directory:

```
$ ../gradlew installDist
```
To run the hello world example with GJEX extensions, run:

```
$ ./build/install/examples/bin/hello-world-server server ./src/main/resources/hello_world_config.yml
```
The gRPC Server, hosted gRPC services and the Jetty server status will be displayed in the console. By attaching an MBeans explorer like JConsole, one can inspect method-level execution metrics for the gRPC services.

And in a different terminal window run:

```
$ ./build/install/examples/bin/hello-world-client
```
